# Multilabel-Book-Genre-Cover-Hues
A multi-label text classifier model which can suggest cover page colors based on the description(with/without title) and genres of a particular book. The predicted set of colors (10) can also be used to generate multi-color Barcode for the book, where we can use the prediction % as the width of the bars.
